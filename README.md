# Multi-Dimensional-Color-Space

## Project Overview:
Designing a multi-dimensional parallel color space to predict color formulation visuals.

## Project Features:
- **Neural Network Formulation:** Utilizing neural networks, regression analysis, and clustering algorithms for precise color formulation.
- **MultiOutputRegressor Model:** Employing a sophisticated MultiOutputRegressor with a linear regression base estimator to predict HEX codes for each formulation.
- **Kubelka-Munk Post-Processing:** Implementing Kubelka-Munk theory in a two-phased method to enhance the realism of color predictions by considering pigment interactions, layer thickness, and concentration.
- **Visualizations:** Strategic use of visualizations based on CMYK, HSL, and CIE-Lab color spaces to guide the formulation optimization process.

## Dataset:
The dataset comprises 29,000 formulations, each uniquely defined by specific ratios of seven primary hair color ingredients. Rigorous preprocessing steps, including feature engineering, data scaling, and outlier removal, ensure a refined input for model training.

## Two-Phased Method:
1. **Machine Learning Prediction:** The machine learning model predicts HEX codes for hair color formulations.
2. **Kubelka-Munk Post-Processing:** Enhances the realism of color predictions by considering physical reactions between pigment and hair.

## Visualizations:
Strategically using visualizations based on CMYK, HSL, and CIE-Lab color spaces to guide the formulation optimization process. The color-encoding framework based on CIE-Lab improves visual perception and information exploration.

## Results:
The integrated approach showcases the project's effectiveness in accurately predicting diverse hair color shades. The strategic use of CIE-Lab visualizations, coupled with the two-phased method incorporating Kubelka-Munk theory, positions this project at the forefront of hair color technology.
